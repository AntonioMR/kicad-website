This the source for the new KiCad webiste, anno 2015.


Start by grabbing the theme, which is added as a submodule:

```
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

Then execute the hugo command in the repository root.

```
hugo -w -v -b http://localhost/
```

== Prerequisites
You will need theese packages:

- http://gohugo.io/[hugo]
- http://asciidoctor.org/[asciidoctor]
- python 2.7 (for kicad-documentation preprocessing)
- GitPython (for kicad-documentation preprocessing)

Using asciidoctor is a requirement, because using bare asciidoc will
not work in parsing the asciidoc files, because of the TOML headers.
This might be a bug upstream in asciidoc, but I have not investigated
this further.

Python 2.7 is required for kicad documentation processing. 
The kicad-doc repo only needs its /src/ content copied over.
Additionally we need to process and fix all the include and image paths
to be relative to the hugo root and not to the subfolder root.
The "GitPython" package for python is needed to pull the kicad-doc repo.
Simply install with "pip install gitpython"
