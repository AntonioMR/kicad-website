This the source for the new KiCad webiste, anno 2015.


Start by grabbing the theme, which is added as a submodule:

```
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

Then execute the hugo command in the repository root.

```
hugo -w -v -b http://localhost/
```

== Prerequisites
You will need theese packages:

- http://gohugo.io/[hugo]
- http://asciidoctor.org/[asciidoctor]

Using asciidoctor is a requirement, because using bare asciidoc will
not work in parsing the asciidoc files, because of the TOML headers.
This might be a bug upstream in asciidoc, but I have not investigated
this further.
