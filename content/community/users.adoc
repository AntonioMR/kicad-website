to get help, for example chris gammels forum, the users mailing list,
IRC...

There exists various resources for KiCad users. The most obvious ones are probably these user communities.

- Chris Gammels http://forum.kicad.info/[user forum].
- http://groups.yahoo.com/group/kicad-users/[Yahoo user mailing list]
- http://kicad.jp/[Japanese fan site]

In addition to this there is also an IRC help channel, which is used by both users and contributing developers. irc://irc.freenode.net/#kicad[#kicad@freenode].
