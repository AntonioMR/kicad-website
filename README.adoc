KiCad Website Source
====================

This the source for the new KiCad website, anno 2015.

== Building

Execute the hugo command in the repository root to build and serve the files:

----
hugo server -w -v -b http://localhost/
----

== Prerequisites
You will need these packages:

- http://gohugo.io/[hugo]
- http://asciidoctor.org/[asciidoctor]

Using asciidoctor is a requirement, because using bare asciidoc will
not work in parsing the asciidoc files, because of the TOML headers.
This might be a bug upstream in asciidoc, but I have not investigated
this further.

== Adding new pages

The desired format for new pages is asciidoc(.adoc) to keep inline with the kicad documentation repo. 
Do not use markdown. 
HTML pages are allowed if special formatting is required (i.e. downloads page).
